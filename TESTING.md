# Testing

This document describes how to run tests for obs-mcp. Run `make help` to see all available targets.

## Linting

Run golangci-lint to check code quality:

```bash
make lint        # check
make lint-fix    # auto-fix
```

## Unit Tests

```bash
make test-unit
```

## Manual Testing

**OpenShift — via kubeconfig (route auto-discovery):**

```bash
make run             # auto-discovers Thanos Querier route (default backend)
make run-prometheus  # auto-discovers Prometheus route (--metrics-backend prometheus)
make run-no-guardrails  # auto-discovers Thanos route, guardrails disabled (use for Thanos < v0.40.0)
```

**OpenShift — via port-forward (header auth, useful when kubeconfig lacks a bearer token):**

```bash
make run-openshift-pf-prometheus     # port-forwards prometheus-k8s-0:9090 + alertmanager-main-0:9093
```

**kube-prometheus or any other backend** — set URLs explicitly:

```bash
PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 ALERTMANAGER_URL=http://localhost:9093 AUTH_MODE=header make run
```

> **Note:** `AUTH_MODE=header` is required for Kind clusters because their kubeconfig uses client certificates instead of bearer tokens. The default `kubeconfig` auth mode will fail with a "kubeconfig doesn't contain a bearer token" error.

Override other defaults as needed:

```bash
LISTEN_ADDR=:8080 LOG_LEVEL=info make run
```

## Kind-based E2E Tests

Tests obs-mcp against a local Kind cluster with kube-prometheus.

```bash
make test-e2e-full          # setup + deploy + test + teardown in one command
```

Or step by step:

```bash
make test-e2e-setup         # create Kind cluster
make test-e2e-deploy        # build and deploy obs-mcp
make test-e2e               # run tests
make test-e2e-teardown      # cleanup
```

## OpenShift E2E Tests

Validates route auto-discovery (`pkg/k8s`) and tool correctness against OpenShift monitoring.

`TestRouteDiscovery_*` exercises `pkg/k8s` directly using the kubeconfig — no running obs-mcp needed.
`TestOpenShiftMetricsPresent` requires `OBS_MCP_URL` and is skipped when not set. In CI, `OBS_MCP_URL` is set automatically by the step registry to point at the deployed obs-mcp instance.

**Authentication:** `TestRouteDiscovery_URLsAreReachable` queries monitoring routes directly. It uses `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` if set (required in CI where the kubeconfig uses client certs that the OAuth proxy rejects), otherwise falls back to the kubeconfig bearer token (works with `oc login`).

```bash
# CI: export a token for route authentication
export OPENSHIFT_TOKEN=$(oc create token prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring)
```

### Route discovery only

Verifies route auto-discovery, URL shape, and that each route responds HTTP 200 when accessed with a bearer token against a real `/api` endpoint.

```bash
make test-e2e-openshift
```

### Full suite including MCP tool smoke tests

Start obs-mcp in one terminal, then run the tests in another:

```bash
make run             # Thanos Querier route (default)
make run-prometheus  # or Prometheus route
```

```bash
OBS_MCP_URL=http://localhost:9100 make test-e2e-openshift   # OpenShift route discovery + metrics
OBS_MCP_URL=http://localhost:9100 make test-e2e             # full MCP tool smoke tests
```

> Note: `make test-e2e` without `OBS_MCP_URL` will attempt a port-forward to a Kind/k8s cluster. It will fail if no `obs-mcp` pod is running in the `obs-mcp` namespace.

## MCPChecker Evals

Validates that AI agents can discover and correctly use obs-mcp tools. See [`evals/mcpchecker/README.md`](evals/mcpchecker/README.md) for installation, environment setup, and detailed usage.

Quick start:

```bash
make run-mcpchecker-eval                          # run all tasks in parallel (1 run each)
make run-mcpchecker-eval CATEGORY=queries          # run by category (metrics, labels, queries, alerts, traces, logs, otelcol)
make run-mcpchecker-eval CATEGORY=logs             # Loki log evals
make run-mcpchecker-eval TASK=cpu-usage             # single task, verbose
make run-mcpchecker-eval RUNS=3                     # multiple runs for consistency testing
```

See [`evals/mcpchecker/README.md`](evals/mcpchecker/README.md) for installation, environment setup, and detailed usage.
